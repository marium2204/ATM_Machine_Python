# ATM_Machine_Python
This program is a Python-based simulation of a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM) interaction.  It allows a user to simulate the process of inserting a card, checking their balance, withdrawing money, and updating their balance accordingly. The program is designed to ensure secure and correct handling of transactions by verifying the withdrawal amount against the userâ€™s current balance and daily withdrawal limit. <br><br>

OBJECTIVES:<br>
To simulate the basic functionality of an ATM.<br>
To validate user inputs for secure transactions.<br>
To ensure that the withdrawal does not exceed the current balance or the daily withdrawal limit.<br>
To provide user-friendly feedback throughout the transaction process.<br><br>

This project can be expanded with additional features like PIN verification, deposit functionality, and integration with a database for real-world application.<br>
